# utils-daily

*This project is currently not available!*

A simple yet useful frontend utility library. The aims of this project are:

- include all functions from lodash library;

- export only frequently-used functions in case of browser environment, otherwise the generated file is too large;

- add my some functions I think useful but not included in lodash;

- use flow and eslint to test code;
